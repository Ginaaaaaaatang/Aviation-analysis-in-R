# Aviation-analysis-in-R


With the popularity of aviation, a safe flight journey becomes more and more critical to the public. Many factors affect aviation accidents, and this analytical dashboard is designed to enable users to discover insights and investigate trends that can improve air travel technology. The target audience for this analytics dashboard is airlines, and this insight can help improve air travel safety and increase flight efficiency. The dashboard aims to help the intended audience identify the possible problems that need to improve and provide insight based on historical data. The narrative visualisation will include the analytics graph that analyses engine and flight phase factors. In addition, the dashboard design allows users to drill down variables in time, animation, different severity of injuries, flight phases, and different country/region to filter and analyse graphics for deeper analysis. The interactive analysis dashboard aims to provide users with different perspectives to create some new insights.
